#
# we want to be able to write expressions involving Vector/Matrix{<:Field}, and
# have the result be efficiently broacasted, i.e. I write, 
#
# x'*M*y 
#
# where x/y::Vector{<:Field} and M::Matrix{<:Field}, and this essentially
# evaluates,
#
# @. x[1]*M[1,1]*x[1] + x[2]*M[2,1]*x[1] + x[1]*M[1,2]*x[2] + x[2]*M[2,2]*x[2]
# 
# which is one single broacasted loop and hence no temporary memory is allocated
# and its fast.
#
# eventually, we should be able to do this with @generated functions which can
# know both the types of the arguments and the expression being broacasted.
# unfortunately, in 0.6 you can't call broadcast from a @generated function,
# although it seems like at some point in the future that could be fixed. 
# 
# thus, for now, we do this with macro's and a custom operator, ⨳, and hard code
# a number of different cases. this is kinda ugly and won't work generally since
# macro's know the expression but not the argument types, but worst case
# scenario is that we just don't optimize a particular expression. the point is
# though eventually we should be able to switch to a solution based on
# @generated functions with no change to the code otherwise.
